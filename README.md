# i-Ready Cheats Decompiled

* A decompilation of some i-Ready cheats. 
** All of these are patched. You can attempt to look at how they work. **

# Some Notes

* Decompilaion is extremely messy.
* Will throw errors.

# What's included

* Nullify 'extension' src

* Nullify 2.0 Bookmarklet src (skidded for readability)

* jVoid (InterVoid) Menu's src
* VoidMenu's Lesson Duper (patched since you can't open lesson iframes anymore, [html5iframe] was the lesson iframe)
* VoidMenu 2.6 (doesn't work)
* Shadow/North Menu's src
* DevHaxx
