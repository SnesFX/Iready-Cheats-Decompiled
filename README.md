# i-Ready Cheats Decompiled
 
* A decompilation of some i-Ready cheats. All of these are patched because C.A. decided to heavily change how some stuff works.

# Some Notes

* This decompilation is mainly usable and somewhat messy.
* Used JSNice for some of the weaker obfuscated ones that don't confuse JSNice
* Used another deobfuscator that's really efficent but it doesn't get some of the names back (not naming here).

# What's included

* Nullify extension src

* Nullify 2.0 Bookmarklet src (skidded for readability)

* jVoid (InterVoid) Menu's src

* VoidMenu's Lesson Duper (patched since you can't open lesson iframes anymore, [html5iframe] was the lesson iframe)

* Void Menu 2.6 (doesn't work)

* Shadow/North Menu's src

* No documentation
